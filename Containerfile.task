# Konflux does not only support running builds in containers locally but also supports running builds
# in remote VMs with the multi-platform controller. In order to simplify the specification of build
# targets, however, we are adding support for the multi-platform controller to also be able to build
# in-cluseter with the tasks focused on building remotely. Therefore, we need to maintain a buildah image
# for our tasks that has more than _just_ buildah in it. We also need to add the required functionality
# for the remote builds.
